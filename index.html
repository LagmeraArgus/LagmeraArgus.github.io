            <p class="page__body">Lagmera Argus is a tall, curvaceous Viera of incredible passion and astonishingly little prudence. Lacking patience and moderation both, she lives life to its fullest at all moments, with her primary activities being flirting with random strangers, imbibing irresponsible quantities of mind-affecting beverages, and gambling. For better or worse, however, she does “mean well”, and truly tries to make people happy, albeit in her own clumsy way. Formerly an incredibly wealthy heiress, she still struggles with the concept of money (and learning when to stop spending it), and has grown all-too-used to living in the lap of luxury. Rejecting commitment wherever possible, engaging in myriad ill-advised trysts, she is nobody’s woman but her own. Since she began studying alchemy, she has worked to improve her focus to little success, instead using intelligence potions in order to gain the clarity of thought required for the exacting discipline.</p>

            <h2 class="page__title">Appearance</h2>
            <p class="page__body">Lagmera is tall for a Viera at 6’3”, and possesses a figure that most describe as ‘unfair’. Despite her rather poor eating habits (she eats chocolate like most people eat bread), she has maintained a thin waist without exercise. However, that is not to say that she is without softness. Her hips would look wide on a mother of three, yet she has no such experience, and her bosom strains the fabric of her dresses and the ingenuity of her tailors both at their unwieldy size. Soft thighs, full, round hindquarters, and a face made to enthrall have proven to be quite the distraction for her companions. To make things worse, she dresses scandalously, drawing the gazes of others wherever she goes. It is a figure entirely undeserved, and rather unfitting of either the head of a trade empire or a student of alchemy. In a word...unfair.</p>
            <p class="page__body">She changes her hair regularly, but generally keeps it dyed in shades of red, and cut short, enjoying daring, bold fashions. Her natural hair color is white, allowing her to mix up her dyes with ease - no bleaching required. Her eyes are a dark, smoky gray, offsetting her unnaturally pale skin, which only grew paler with her lack of any labor under the sun. She keeps a set of two stars on her left cheek, painted on each morning, because “they look pretty”, enjoying the playful asymmetry they provide.</p>
          </article>
          <article class="page page--story" id="story">
            <h2 class="page__title">Story</h2>
            <p class="page__body">Her mother, Jasali Argus, left Golmore Jungle while with child, being exiled due to spending too much time outside the jungle having a dalliance with a pirate captain, Solkeidin Gybalitarsyn. The man who gave her the child is unknown to Lagmera - her mother never revealed her true father.</p>
            <p class="page__body">Solkeidin took Jasali back to Limsa, the two of them getting wed whilst still aboard the ship, and Jasali gave birth to Lagmera in Limsa Lominsa. She and Solkeidin raised her, with Jasali quickly adopting Lominsan culture, resulting in Lagmera not being raised with any real traditional Viera customs.</p>
            <p class="page__body">Solkeidin in particular was a big influence on her - after his wife had her child, he retired from piracy and became a "legitimate" mercenary for some years, followed by an actually legitimate sea trader. However, he kept up the culture of the pirate ship, leading to Lagmera taking on even more of a boisterous, brash nature than most Lominsans. She looked up to him as her inspiration for most of her life.</p>
            <p class="page__body">Lacking a formal education, she instead received knowledge firsthand from her father, who taught her of combat, making trades, sailing a ship, and even cooking. However, the lessons that she showed the most promise with were his riddles - Solkeidin loved riddles and puzzles, and often gave particularly-tough problems to Lagmera, enjoying seeing her figure them out. Her fondest memories are of spending months on her father’s ship, puzzling out the answers to his latest riddle.</p>
            <p class="page__body">She spent much of her childhood helping out her father aboard his ship, seeing her mother more infrequently, as she managed affairs back on shore. Despite their separation, or perhaps because of it, the two got along very well whenever they were together. Lagmera liked her mother, but was always more comfortable with her stepfather. He was completely enthralled with Lagmera, and considered her his proper daughter in all ways - spoiling her constantly with lavish gifts.</p>
            <p class="page__body">During the events of the Calamity, Solkeidin joined with the Maelstrom to help fight back the Garleans. He refused to allow Lagmera to participate, as she was too young to put herself in such danger (she was 16 at the time), and sent her home. Lagmera had not realized until too late that he had sent her home - having thought that she was going to the scene of the battle. That said, even with her father’s instruction, she was not a particularly good combatant, and she would not have added much.</p>
            <p class="page__body">When she got home she discovered that her mother had also left, refusing to leave her husband's side during the battle, the woman apparently sensing the danger that he was about to be put in and not wishing him to go through it alone. The two fought fiercely, but, like many who participated in the battle of Carteneau, they perished. Lagmera deeply regretted not having been able to be there herself, and cursed her father for sending her away.</p>
            <p class="page__body">In the wake of the Calamity, Lagmera lost everything - even her father's old ship, the Overly Zealous. She spent much of her time after that poor and homeless even as she did her best to rebuild, like many others who survived the Calamity. In particular, she used her skills as a sailor to retrieve materials and goods from shipwrecks. It was a hard time for her, as she was used to a very rich life.</p>
            <p class="page__body">One day, two years after the Calamity, while she was trawling the coasts of Limsa with a makeshift boat, she found something special. She had managed to pull up a sealed chest out of a shipwreck, a very rare find. She opened it, and discovered that it had come from her father's ship. Inside was some coin, as well as a map. She used the coin to travel to the map's coordinates, searching the area for some time, trying to find what her father had left behind.</p>
            <p class="page__body">It was not long before she discovered some of her father's favorite types of riddles etched into the stone walls of a cave on the barren island. She followed the riddles, piecing together his last puzzle, then finally came across a massive store of pirate treasures that her father had squirreled away, about a year after starting the journey.</p>
            <p class="page__body">She was instantly rich, and now a full adult at the age of 19. She used a good sum of her treasures to help rebuild the area for some time, wanting to help as she could. But, once Limsa Lominsa was thriving again, she used her money to seek out her father's old trading partner, X'ioga, who had masterminded many of her father's trade deals before the Calamity. She and X’ioga re-established the Argus Trading company that her father had made (he had named it after his wife, despite doing most of the deals himself).</p>
            <p class="page__body">With X’ioga at the helm of the trade company, she put herself in a figurehead position, knowing she didn’t have his financial acumen, and allowed him to run things his way. Within the span of the first year, he had nearly doubled the massive fortune her father had left behind, and she became not merely rich, but truly wealthy. Delighting in the finer things, she soon took to a life of gleeful excess, spending her time at the Gold Saucer, spending her money freely, in between purchasing lavish outfits.</p>
            <p class="page__body">It seemed perfect, for a time. She was 21, and richer than ever - X’ioga continued to work his magic, and pay dividends to the Argus Trading Company’s chief, Lagmera Argus. She had no interest in ever pursuing a “real” job, and was perfectly content socializing, gambling, and enjoying herself to her heart’s content.</p>
            <p class="page__body">All of that changed, however, when she happened to bring a massive scandal onto the company name due to a series of ill-advised drunken escapades in Kugane, leading to the East Aldenard Trading Company threatening to cut off all of the Argus Trading Company’s deals unless she were immediately removed. Faced with no other option, X’ioga cut her loose to preserve her father’s legacy (and the livelihoods of those working in the Company), leaving her adrift.</p>
            <p class="page__body">Completely unable to manage her money, Lagmera stumbled from false friend to false friend, begging for a place to stay - as soon as they learned the money was gone, she was turned out at each one. Faced with no other option, she went to Kathrine, of Cold Throne Steel. Lagmera had invested in the shop some months prior, and, thankfully, the investment had resulted in Kathrine having enough room to house her - on the condition that Lagmera provide for the house. She had to find herself a proper job.</p>
            <p class="page__body">After a week went by with no success, she contacted a former business partner of hers - Kumope Yemope, a lalafell who had been her primary source of her more illegal pastimes for years. Asking if he had any ideas on where to find work, he pointed her to the Gilded Mortar, a small group of alchemists with somewhat lower standards than the Alchemist’s guild. To help her breeze through the interview process, he also gave her a potent potion of intelligence.</p>
            <p class="page__body">However, when she met with Baldwin, the leader of the organization, the plan quickly fell apart. Baldwin discovered that she had used an intelligence potion in order to falsely heighten her abilities, and realized that he could take advantage of that for his own ends. He put her to work synthesizing basic reagents until her potion wore off, then, while she was back in her admittedly-absent-minded state, gave her another potion of intelligence and told her to finish her shift. This one, however, contained a subtle and insidious poison that would prevent her mind from forming new memories so long as it was in her system.</p>
            <p class="page__body">With her unknowingly imbibing memory-stealing potions at work, she had no idea just what it was that she was doing. To make matters worse, she was naive enough to blame the memory loss on her not being able to understand what she was doing, as she believed that whatever work she was doing was simply far too complex for her non-potion-enhanced mind to recall. As such, she soon became deeply entangled within the schemes of the Gilded Mortar, who used her to produce deadly and illegal poisons, selling them to assassins and cutthroats for incredible sums.</p>
            <p class="page__body">The plan was only revealed when, while at work, the potion-enhanced Viera stealthily penned coded messages to herself and his them on her person. Unfortunately, her mind was not quick enough without the potions to decipher them - but with the help of Kathrine and Bardon of Cold Throne Steel, the contents were revealed after four days of work, exposing the entire plan of the Gilded Mortar - including that Baldwin was likely about to kidnap her, growing suspicious of her recent actions.</p>
            <p class="page__body">As such, Kathrine ordered Lagmera to not leave the house without an armed guard, the entire company now at the forefront of a battle between the rogue alchemists of the Gilded Mortar, who sought to kidnap her, and the agents of the Brass Blades, who searched for the alchemist responsible for the poisonings. Lagmera soon found tasks to busy herself with back at home, however, with Kathrine lending her the funds necessary to purchase herself alchemist’s supplies of her own, and even hiring her a tutor from the alchemist’s guild to teach her the craft properly.</p>
            <p class="page__body">Currently, she still lingers in near house arrest, dependent on the time of others to see the outside world, with only alchemy to keep her from absolute boredom. Her sense of self-preservation is high enough for her to not risk going outside to stave off that boredom, for the moment at least, but there is no telling what may happen to the unfortunate Viera next.</p>

            <p class="page__body">I am a long-time rper (been rping since 2007!), but somewhat new to Final Fantasy RP (or any MMO rp). I tend to write para to multi-para consistently, though I try to tone my wordiness down when in group settings or a faster-paced scene. I am generally able to get along with most anyone, and am not a huge stickler for lore (though I find characters that use the existing lore creatively to be my very favourites), but I do require full literacy from my partners to get any fun out of it. I enjoy weaving everything that happens into a single cohesive story, and try to avoid declaring things as “non-canon” unless absolutely needed. I’m into ERP (almost anything goes with me), but I honestly prefer long-term, story-focused rps nowadays. I work full-time, and have a variety of real-life obligations that prevent me from spending every day online, but I do try to be on frequently - and if I make a date to RP, I do my best to keep it. I’m also happy to share my Discord handle to those who want to reach me there (I love rping in Discord too, by the way - IM rp is what I’ve been doing for most my life, after all!)</p>
            <p class="page__body">All in all, feel free to reach out! I’m sure that you and I will get along!</p>

            <p class="page__body">If your character can see the aether of others, then this info may be of use!</p>
            <p class="page__body">Lagmera has a violently energetic aether, aspected strongly to lightning, and a bit less strongly towards water. It is chaotic, often flaring with her moods, but never dims for long.</p>
