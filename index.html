            <h2 class="page__title">Bio</h2>
            <p class="page__body">Sunna Argus is a graceful, gregarious woman with an alarmingly laissez-faire attitude towards life. Cast out from the trading company that she helped create, she now lives at Cold Throne Steel, a former blacksmith’s shop. Over the past four years, she has built up her alchemical knowledge and business acumen, and has successfully formed her own potion shop - The Chimera’s Cauldron. Additionally, she has been studying under her wife, Skoll to master a form of blue magic practised deep within the Golmore Jungle, one that requires the blue mage to devour the creatures they wish to embody, then tattoo aetheric designs upon their own flesh to seal the power within them. As a result, she has gained the ability to change her body, taking on the aspects of the beasts that she has consumed. But, the most important change that she’s undergone has been becoming a mother. Thanks to her wives, Skoll and Allfea, she is now the proud mother of six young kits, with a seventh still growing within Allfea.</p>
            <p class="page__body">Being a parent has smoothed out some of Sunna’s rougher edges, and as such, she tries to not use drugs excessively, avoids gambling, and tries to stay out of trouble with the law. However, she is still the same person who got herself banished from Kugane, and she at times slips up and falls back into her old habits. With six children that are all just over three years old, she’s quite the busy mother. As such, she’s often burdened by the stress of looking after her young ones, combined with the stress of running her own business to support her family. Even so, she tries very hard to keep up a cheerful, unbothered demeanour, often laughing and joking at the most serious of times.</p>

            <h2 class="page__title">Appearance</h2>
            <p class="page__body">Sunna is tall, even for a Viera, standing at 6 films and three ilms, and always stands out in a crowd. Her dark grey eyes contrast sharply with her ghostly-pale skin, and her short, bright red hair is always prominently displayed. Her figure is excessively motherly, which fits her, considering how excessive her motherhood has been. A combination of natural gifts, an extremely-productive pregnancy, and an alchemical mixup involving cow aether has resulted in the Veena having a chest that easily weighs over twenty ponze on its own. Similarly, her hips, while wide to begin with, have only grown since delivering six kits in one night, not to mention the result of all of that baby weight.</p>
            <p class="page__body">Her once trim and lean figure has softened and rounded out considerably, with the mother bun now possessing a pair of ample thighs, a set of hindquarters that beggar belief, and a soft, squishy tummy with several pale red stretch marks. The two red stars painted upon her left cheek have stayed in place for years, being nearly as much of a trademark as her bright red hair. Of course, her most unique features would be her horns. Indeed, upon her head sit a pair of black cow’s horns, sticking about four ilms tall between her ears, a keepsake from a morally-challenged alchemist who spiked her drink.</p>
            <p class="page__body">It took her some time to adapt to all these changes, but she’s already gone back to considering herself the most beautiful woman in the world. As such, she’s gone from hiding her slowly-growing horns under hats to prominently displaying them, and even accessorising them with custom-made jewellery.</p>

            <h2 class="page__title">Story</h2>
            <p class="page__body">Her mother, Jasali Argus, left Golmore Jungle while with child, being exiled due to spending too much time outside the jungle having a dalliance with a pirate captain, Solkeidin Gybalitarsyn. The man who gave her the child is unknown to Sunna - her mother never revealed her true father.</p>
            <p class="page__body">Solkeidin took Jasali back to Limsa, the two of them getting wed whilst still aboard the ship, and Jasali gave birth to Sunna in Limsa Lominsa. She and Solkeidin raised her, with Jasali quickly adopting Lominsan culture, resulting in Sunna not being raised with any real traditional Viera customs.</p>
            <p class="page__body">Solkeidin in particular was a big influence on her - after his wife had her child, he retired from piracy and became a "legitimate" mercenary for some years, followed by an actually legitimate sea trader. However, he kept up the culture of the pirate ship, leading to Sunna taking on even more of a boisterous, brash nature than most Lominsans. She looked up to him as her inspiration for most of her life.</p>
            <p class="page__body">Lacking a formal education, she instead received knowledge firsthand from her father, who taught her of combat, making trades, sailing a ship, and even cooking. However, the lessons that she showed the most promise with were his riddles - Solkeidin loved riddles and puzzles, and often gave particularly-tough problems to Sunna, enjoying seeing her figure them out. Her fondest memories are of spending months on her father’s ship, puzzling out the answers to his latest riddle.</p>
            <p class="page__body">She spent much of her childhood helping out her father aboard his ship, seeing her mother more infrequently, as she managed affairs back on shore. Despite their separation, or perhaps because of it, the two got along very well whenever they were together. Sunna liked her mother, but was always more comfortable with her stepfather. He was completely enthralled with Sunna, and considered her his proper daughter in all ways - spoiling her constantly with lavish gifts.</p>
            <p class="page__body">During the events of the Calamity, Solkeidin joined with the Maelstrom to help fight back the Garleans. He refused to allow Sunna to participate, as she was too young to put herself in such danger (she was 16 at the time), and sent her home. Sunna had not realized until too late that he had sent her home - having thought that she was going to the scene of the battle. That said, even with her father’s instruction, she was not a particularly good combatant, and she would not have added much.</p>
            <p class="page__body">When she got home she discovered that her mother had also left, refusing to leave her husband's side during the battle, the woman apparently sensing the danger that he was about to be put in and not wishing him to go through it alone. The two fought fiercely, but, like many who participated in the battle of Carteneau, they perished. Sunna deeply regretted not having been able to be there herself, and cursed her father for sending her away.</p>
            <p class="page__body">In the wake of the Calamity, Sunna lost everything - even her father's old ship, the Overly Zealous. She spent much of her time after that poor and homeless even as she did her best to rebuild, like many others who survived the Calamity. In particular, she used her skills as a sailor to retrieve materials and goods from shipwrecks. It was a hard time for her, as she was used to a very rich life.</p>
            <p class="page__body">One day, two years after the Calamity, while she was trawling the coasts of Limsa with a makeshift boat, she found something special. She had managed to pull up a sealed chest out of a shipwreck, a very rare find. She opened it, and discovered that it had come from her father's ship. Inside was some coin, as well as a map. She used the coin to travel to the map's coordinates, searching the area for some time, trying to find what her father had left behind.</p>
            <p class="page__body">It was not long before she discovered some of her father's favorite types of riddles etched into the stone walls of a cave on the barren island. She followed the riddles, piecing together his last puzzle, then finally came across a massive store of pirate treasures that her father had squirreled away, about a year after starting the journey.</p>
            <p class="page__body">She was instantly rich, and now a full adult at the age of 19. She used a good sum of her treasures to help rebuild the area for some time, wanting to help as she could. But, once Limsa Lominsa was thriving again, she used her money to seek out her father's old trading partner, X'ioga, who had masterminded many of her father's trade deals before the Calamity. She and X’ioga re-established the Argus Trading company that her father had made (he had named it after his wife, despite doing most of the deals himself).</p>
            <p class="page__body">With X’ioga at the helm of the trade company, she put herself in a figurehead position, knowing she didn’t have his financial acumen, and allowed him to run things his way. Within the span of the first year, he had nearly doubled the massive fortune her father had left behind, and she became not merely rich, but truly wealthy. Delighting in the finer things, she soon took to a life of gleeful excess, spending her time at the Gold Saucer, spending her money freely, in between purchasing lavish outfits.</p>
            <p class="page__body">It seemed perfect, for a time. She was 21, and richer than ever - X’ioga continued to work his magic, and pay dividends to the Argus Trading Company’s chief, Sunna Argus. She had no interest in ever pursuing a “real” job, and was perfectly content socializing, gambling, and enjoying herself to her heart’s content.</p>
            <p class="page__body">All of that changed, however, when she happened to bring a massive scandal onto the company name due to a series of ill-advised drunken escapades in Kugane, leading to the East Aldenard Trading Company threatening to cut off all of the Argus Trading Company’s deals unless she were immediately removed. Faced with no other option, X’ioga cut her loose to preserve her father’s legacy (and the livelihoods of those working in the Company), leaving her adrift.</p>
            <p class="page__body">Completely unable to manage her money, Sunna stumbled from false friend to false friend, begging for a place to stay - as soon as they learned the money was gone, she was turned out at each one. Faced with no other option, she went to Kathrine, of Cold Throne Steel. Sunna had invested in the shop some months prior, and, thankfully, the investment had resulted in Kathrine having enough room to house her - on the condition that Sunna provide for the house. She had to find herself a proper job.</p>
            <p class="page__body">After a week went by with no success, she contacted a former business partner of hers - Kumope Yemope, a lalafell who had been her primary source of her more illegal pastimes for years. Asking if he had any ideas on where to find work, he pointed her to the Gilded Mortar, a small group of alchemists with somewhat lower standards than the Alchemist’s guild. To help her breeze through the interview process, he also gave her a potent potion of intelligence.</p>
            <p class="page__body">However, when she met with Baldwin, the leader of the organization, the plan quickly fell apart. Baldwin discovered that she had used an intelligence potion in order to falsely heighten her abilities, and realized that he could take advantage of that for his own ends. He put her to work synthesizing basic reagents until her potion wore off, then, while she was back in her admittedly-absent-minded state, gave her another potion of intelligence and told her to finish her shift. This one, however, contained a subtle and insidious poison that would prevent her mind from forming new memories so long as it was in her system.</p>
            <p class="page__body">With her unknowingly imbibing memory-stealing potions at work, she had no idea just what it was that she was doing. To make matters worse, she was naive enough to blame the memory loss on her not being able to understand what she was doing, as she believed that whatever work she was doing was simply far too complex for her non-potion-enhanced mind to recall. As such, she soon became deeply entangled within the schemes of the Gilded Mortar, who used her to produce deadly and illegal poisons, selling them to assassins and cutthroats for incredible sums.</p>
            <p class="page__body">The plan was only revealed when, while at work, the potion-enhanced Viera stealthily penned coded messages to herself and his them on her person. Unfortunately, her mind was not quick enough without the potions to decipher them - but with the help of Kathrine and Bardon of Cold Throne Steel, the contents were revealed after four days of work, exposing the entire plan of the Gilded Mortar - including that Baldwin was likely about to kidnap her, growing suspicious of her recent actions.</p>
            <p class="page__body">As such, Kathrine ordered Sunna to not leave the house without an armed guard, the entire company now at the forefront of a battle between the rogue alchemists of the Gilded Mortar, who sought to kidnap her, and the agents of the Brass Blades, who searched for the alchemist responsible for the poisonings. Sunna soon found tasks to busy herself with back at home, however, with Kathrine lending her the funds necessary to purchase herself alchemist’s supplies of her own, and even hiring her a tutor from the alchemist’s guild to teach her the craft properly.</p>
            <p class="page__body">After months of languishing in what was effectively house arrest, Sunna’s life was put in danger once more when the Gilded Mortar came to abduct her. Through a combined effort of the entire blacksmith’s shop, the ruffians were beaten back and their leader arrested, though not without a cost - many of the shop’s workers, and even Kathrine herself, were injured as a result. After seeing how her friends had thrown themselves into such peril to save her, Sunna vowed to do better by them, and began working to become more independent and responsible.</p>
            <p class="page__body">After a chance meeting with Skoll Suneather, a mysterious Viera blue mage, she began learning a branch of blue magic that stemmed from deep within the Golmore Jungle, looking for a way to protect herself and her friends. It has been a long and difficult road, and she is only just beginning, but she has given her all to mastering this strange discipline. Due to the manner in which the magic works, she has had mythril-ink designs of various beasts tattooed onto her body, allowing her to temporarily shift her form to better protect herself.</p>
            <p class="page__body">A strange encounter with an enchanted artifact (that she accidentally dropped and shattered) resulted in her aether being bound to two others in the blacksmith’s shop - Bardon and Kathrine. As result, all three of them share sensations, what one feels, the other two do as well. The more straight-laced Bardon and Kathrine soon tired of dealing with Sunna’s habits and how they affected them, and they set out on an expedition to the ruins in which the artifact had first been found, to break the curse. However, a rather unfortunate airship crash brought them down, where they were attacked by bandits. Barely managing to escape thanks to her new blue magic abilities, she was permanently scarred after killing a man during the chaos.</p>
            <p class="page__body">Struggling with the consequences and responsibilities of her newfound power, she does her best to keep up her front of laughter and merriment, all while trying to wrestle with her own image of herself. Through help from Taerha and Skoll, she gradually processed the trauma and came out of the experience with hardened resolve.</p>
            <p class="page__body">Months later, Sunna, Taerha, Kathrine, and Bardon journeyed once more to end their strange curse, barely surviving a brutal ruin filled with deadly magics, but ultimately achieving their goal, separating the unwanted bond between them. It was then that she revealed what she had known for only a moon, that she was pregnant with Skoll’s children, a result of her desperate attempts to lose herself in the Rava’s affections after the trauma of the airship.</p>
            <p class="page__body">Dealing with the unexpected pregnancy was hard, particularly in Skoll’s absence, but over time, she adjusted to the changes, thanks to the continual support of her dear friends. During this time, she married Skoll and Allfea both, though obviously not in any temple. Due to bigamy being rather frowned upon, she kept the ceremony small and private, but refused to hide her love for both of her wives, even if it brought her trouble. With the help of Skoll’s blue magic training, she was able to deliver an astounding six children in a single night, and her life as a new mother began.</p>
            <p class="page__body">Raising so many young kits has been hard on her, and Sunna struggles to even remember much of the first two years, thanks to the incredible stress and chronic lack of sleep. However, she and her wives slowly got the hang of it, and as her children grew less and less fragile, she’s been able to adopt a more healthy lifestyle. Due to a series of strange coincidences, a great many people left Cold Throne Steel, which pulled the owner into a slump, the smith hanging up her hammer. Sunna turned the sad situation into an opportunity, taking the vacant rooms for a nursery, a playroom, and a shared bedroom for the kits.</p>
            <p class="page__body">Around half a year after the kits were born, an alchemist by the name of Arryn spiked her food with an unknown reagent that caused a rapid fluctuation in her aether. Unbeknownst to the alchemist, Sunna was wearing earrings imbued with cow aether, and the fluctuations ended up mixing her own aether with what was stored in her earrings. The resulting change was a massively-increased bust, inordinate lactation, and the growth of small horns atop her head. Obviously, this was rather concerning to the young mother, but she ended up welcoming the changes after some time, using her much-higher milk production to feed her kits and also make money on the side.</p>
            <p class="page__body">As she grew more capable of balancing her hectic life, Sunna began to focus more upon her business, and used her unique assets as a marketing gimmick, naming her little shop The Chimera’s Cauldron. With her friends and her beloved wives looking after the kits, the Veena put a surprising amount of effort into the discipline of alchemy, and finally began to truly understand how aether worked. Bridging the gaps in her knowledge through persistent study, she finally grew competent enough to make her own potions from scratch after a year of intense practice.</p>
            <p class="page__body">Now, The Chimera’s Cauldron has become surprisingly-profitable, with Sunna using her hard-won alchemy knowledge in conjunction with her first-hand experience with various drugs and her study of aether mixing from Skoll’s blue magic lessons to make some truly unique concoctions. While she’s nowhere near a master, she has nonetheless shown to be far more intelligent than she initially let on - or initially believed, and is only learning more by the day. Intent on paying back Kathrine Throne, her landlady, for all of her compassion, she has focused on making The Chimera’s Cauldron as successful as possible, so she can take care of her dear friend. Plus, it’s rather hard to keep six kits fed and clothed - every spare gil helps.</p>

            <section class="relationship">
              <h3 class="page__subtitle">Skoll Suneater</h3>
              <p class="page__body">An incredible Viera woman whom Sunna took as her wife. Skoll has been teaching Sunna much about life in the homeland she never knew. After a chance encounter on the Ul’Dahn streets, Skoll has begun tutoring Sunna in her tribe’s unusual form of blue magic, which Sunna hopes to use to both defend herself and increase the profitability of her business. The two are also deeply in love with each other, though their relationship is more than just romantic, with Skoll even collaring the Veena as her pet as well as her wife. After a particularly risky night, Skoll ended up making a mother of Sunna, much to her surprise. Nonetheless, she has been wonderfully-accepting of her, and has put an incredible amount of effort into raising the children well, earning Sunna’s eternal love and gratitude.</p>

              <h3 class="page__subtitle">Allfea Soulmen</h3>
              <p class="page__body">A darling lalafellin woman whom Sunna took as her wife. Allfea joined Cold Throne Steel as a secretary, trader, and novice weaver. She actually used to be an acquaintance of Sunna’s, back when Sunna was still running her business empire, but their drunken trysts involved so much alcohol that both of them are quite hazy on the particulars. Nonetheless, they quickly renewed their friendship and their affections, and Sunna fell head over heels for her. Their delightful dates are a beacon of joy, and nothing makes Sunna happier than seeing Allfea smile. Allfea has been one of the most involved in raising her children, and they consider the children to be Allfea’s as well. After much deliberation, Sunna has given Allfea her seventh child, who now grows within her womb.</p>

              <h3 class="page__subtitle">Taerha Njoren</h3>
              <p class="page__body">An absolutely wonderful Rava she met through Kathrine, Taerha has proven to be one of Sunna’s truest companions, and a fantastic lover besides. Sunna often turns to the kind botanist for help, whether that be through her teas and infusions or, much more commonly, her incredible emotional support and life advice. Without a doubt, Tae is one of the people that Sunna cares for and trusts the most, and she is one of the major driving forces in Sunna’s attempts to improve herself. In particular, Taerha even has been helping her acquire the ‘materials’ needed for her blue mage training, protecting her as she guides her through the wilderness. Tae has also helped Sunna raise her kits, which Sunna is forever grateful for.</p>

              <h3 class="page__subtitle">Kathrine Throne</h3>
              <p class="page__body">Sunna’s landlady and creditor, who took her in when all others cast her aside. She is one of the few people Sunna has enough sense to properly fear and respect, having seen hints of the rage that burns beneath her cold exterior, as well as its grim results. However, she has also forged a deep bond with the woman over time, and trusts her entirely. The two of them have gradually grown closer, but Sunna is still somewhat in awe of the woman’s strong character. With Kathrine’s mood being so dour lately, Sunna has done her best to look after her, and has grown all the closer with her, now that she sees that she is not invulnerable.</p>

              <h3 class="page__subtitle">Luvsan Dazkar</h3>
              <p class="page__body">Sunna’s former personal chef, now working for all of Cold Throne Steel. She is entirely unaware that he is in fact a straggler from a group of vicious bandits, and is simply doing his best to survive until he rejoins the group. She thinks of him only as her loyal, uncommunicative servant - though she is quite grateful for him staying with her even after her financial difficulties.</p>

              <h3 class="page__subtitle">Czethgar Natash</h3>
              <p class="page__body">A former gladiator, Czethgar ran deep into debt and was sold to Sunna as an indentured servant. She promptly freed him, then bid him to work for her as an employee, instead of as a slave. He loyally followed her, and the two had a quite amicable relationship, becoming lovers quickly, once her charms won him over.</p>

            <h2 class="page__title">OOC</h2>
            <p class="page__body">I am a long-time rper (been rping since 2007!), but somewhat new to Final Fantasy RP (or any MMO rp). I tend to write para to multi-para consistently, though I try to tone my wordiness down when in group settings or a faster-paced scene. I am generally able to get along with most anyone, and am not a huge stickler for lore (though I find characters that use the existing lore creatively to be my very favourites), but I do require full literacy from my partners to get any fun out of it. I enjoy weaving everything that happens into a single cohesive story, and try to avoid declaring things as “non-canon” unless absolutely needed. I’m into ERP (almost anything goes with me), but I honestly prefer long-term, story-focused rps nowadays. I work full-time, and have a variety of real-life obligations that prevent me from spending every day online, but I do try to be on frequently - and if I make a date to RP, I do my best to keep it. I’m also happy to share my Discord handle to those who want to reach me there (I love rping in Discord too, by the way - IM rp is what I’ve been doing for most my life, after all! I tend to be FAR more responsive there!)</p>
            <p class="page__body">All in all, feel free to reach out! I’m sure that you and I will get along!</p>

            <p class="page__body">If your character can see the aether of others, then this info may be of use!</p>
            <p class="page__body">Sunna has a violently energetic aether, aspected strongly to lightning, and a bit less strongly towards water. It is chaotic, often flaring with her moods, but never dims for long. As well, the various hidden tattoos on her body are each filled with a different beast’s aether, making her own seem even more mixed-up. Her aether has a profoundly strange “texture” to it, a result of her aether being mixed with a cow’s at a deep level, resulting in odd ripples.</p>
