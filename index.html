            <p class="page__body">Sunna argus is a cheerful, witty, and extremely excitable Veena, possessed of a warm and loving heart. She has her trials at times, lacking patience, prudence, and moderation all, but she nonetheless always acts with the best of intentions. Formerly an incredibly-wealthy heiress to the Argus Trading Company, she grew too-used to living in the lap of luxury, and still struggles with not spending her money as fast as she gets it, if not faster. However, she has strengths as well, with a quick and facile mind, a surprisingly-strong will that has kept her from committing to any one person, valuing her independence above all things.</p>
            <p class="page__body">Dabbling in a variety of careers, she is simultaneously a former trading company executive, an amatuer alchemist, and an apprentice blue mage. Her alchemy is still at a rather basic level, enough for her to brew some intoxicating cocktails and basic curative agents, but not much more. Her blue mage skills are rather basic as well, though she does now possess the ability to form venomous fangs, sharp teeth, and eyes that can freeze with a glance. All of that has been put to the side, however, as a rather unexpected change to her life arrived, a pregnancy that neither party had planned for. She now is doing her best to try and secure a stable life for her children, dealing with the changes as best as she can.</p>

            <h2 class="page__title">Appearance</h2>
            <p class="page__body">Sunna is tall for a Viera at 6’3”, and possesses a figure that most describe as ‘unfair’. Despite her rather poor eating habits (she eats chocolate like most people eat bread), she has maintained a thin waist without exercise. However, that is not to say that she is without softness. Her hips would look wide on a mother of three, yet she has no such experience, and her bosom strains the fabric of her dresses and the ingenuity of her tailors both at their unwieldy size. Soft thighs, full, round hindquarters, and a face made to enthrall have proven to be quite the distraction for her companions. To make things worse, she dresses scandalously, drawing the gazes of others wherever she goes. It is a figure entirely undeserved, and rather unfitting of either the head of a trade empire or a student of alchemy. In a word...unfair.</p>
            <p class="page__body">She changes her hair regularly, but generally keeps it dyed in shades of red, and cut short, enjoying daring, bold fashions. Her natural hair color is white, allowing her to mix up her dyes with ease - no bleaching required. Her eyes are a dark, smoky gray, offsetting her unnaturally pale skin, which only grew paler with her lack of any labor under the sun. She keeps a set of two stars on her left cheek, painted on each morning, because “they look pretty”, enjoying the playful asymmetry they provide.</p>

          <article class="page page--story" id="story">
            <h2 class="page__title">Story</h2>
            <p class="page__body">Her mother, Jasali Argus, left Golmore Jungle while with child, being exiled due to spending too much time outside the jungle having a dalliance with a pirate captain, Solkeidin Gybalitarsyn. The man who gave her the child is unknown to Sunna - her mother never revealed her true father.</p>
            <p class="page__body">Solkeidin took Jasali back to Limsa, the two of them getting wed whilst still aboard the ship, and Jasali gave birth to Sunna in Limsa Lominsa. She and Solkeidin raised her, with Jasali quickly adopting Lominsan culture, resulting in Sunna not being raised with any real traditional Viera customs.</p>
            <p class="page__body">Solkeidin in particular was a big influence on her - after his wife had her child, he retired from piracy and became a "legitimate" mercenary for some years, followed by an actually legitimate sea trader. However, he kept up the culture of the pirate ship, leading to Sunna taking on even more of a boisterous, brash nature than most Lominsans. She looked up to him as her inspiration for most of her life.</p>
            <p class="page__body">Lacking a formal education, she instead received knowledge firsthand from her father, who taught her of combat, making trades, sailing a ship, and even cooking. However, the lessons that she showed the most promise with were his riddles - Solkeidin loved riddles and puzzles, and often gave particularly-tough problems to Sunna, enjoying seeing her figure them out. Her fondest memories are of spending months on her father’s ship, puzzling out the answers to his latest riddle.</p>
            <p class="page__body">She spent much of her childhood helping out her father aboard his ship, seeing her mother more infrequently, as she managed affairs back on shore. Despite their separation, or perhaps because of it, the two got along very well whenever they were together. Sunna liked her mother, but was always more comfortable with her stepfather. He was completely enthralled with Sunna, and considered her his proper daughter in all ways - spoiling her constantly with lavish gifts.</p>
            <p class="page__body">During the events of the Calamity, Solkeidin joined with the Maelstrom to help fight back the Garleans. He refused to allow Sunna to participate, as she was too young to put herself in such danger (she was 16 at the time), and sent her home. Sunna had not realized until too late that he had sent her home - having thought that she was going to the scene of the battle. That said, even with her father’s instruction, she was not a particularly good combatant, and she would not have added much.</p>
            <p class="page__body">When she got home she discovered that her mother had also left, refusing to leave her husband's side during the battle, the woman apparently sensing the danger that he was about to be put in and not wishing him to go through it alone. The two fought fiercely, but, like many who participated in the battle of Carteneau, they perished. Sunna deeply regretted not having been able to be there herself, and cursed her father for sending her away.</p>
            <p class="page__body">In the wake of the Calamity, Sunna lost everything - even her father's old ship, the Overly Zealous. She spent much of her time after that poor and homeless even as she did her best to rebuild, like many others who survived the Calamity. In particular, she used her skills as a sailor to retrieve materials and goods from shipwrecks. It was a hard time for her, as she was used to a very rich life.</p>
            <p class="page__body">One day, two years after the Calamity, while she was trawling the coasts of Limsa with a makeshift boat, she found something special. She had managed to pull up a sealed chest out of a shipwreck, a very rare find. She opened it, and discovered that it had come from her father's ship. Inside was some coin, as well as a map. She used the coin to travel to the map's coordinates, searching the area for some time, trying to find what her father had left behind.</p>
            <p class="page__body">It was not long before she discovered some of her father's favorite types of riddles etched into the stone walls of a cave on the barren island. She followed the riddles, piecing together his last puzzle, then finally came across a massive store of pirate treasures that her father had squirreled away, about a year after starting the journey.</p>
            <p class="page__body">She was instantly rich, and now a full adult at the age of 19. She used a good sum of her treasures to help rebuild the area for some time, wanting to help as she could. But, once Limsa Lominsa was thriving again, she used her money to seek out her father's old trading partner, X'ioga, who had masterminded many of her father's trade deals before the Calamity. She and X’ioga re-established the Argus Trading company that her father had made (he had named it after his wife, despite doing most of the deals himself).</p>
            <p class="page__body">With X’ioga at the helm of the trade company, she put herself in a figurehead position, knowing she didn’t have his financial acumen, and allowed him to run things his way. Within the span of the first year, he had nearly doubled the massive fortune her father had left behind, and she became not merely rich, but truly wealthy. Delighting in the finer things, she soon took to a life of gleeful excess, spending her time at the Gold Saucer, spending her money freely, in between purchasing lavish outfits.</p>
            <p class="page__body">It seemed perfect, for a time. She was 21, and richer than ever - X’ioga continued to work his magic, and pay dividends to the Argus Trading Company’s chief, Sunna Argus. She had no interest in ever pursuing a “real” job, and was perfectly content socializing, gambling, and enjoying herself to her heart’s content.</p>
            <p class="page__body">All of that changed, however, when she happened to bring a massive scandal onto the company name due to a series of ill-advised drunken escapades in Kugane, leading to the East Aldenard Trading Company threatening to cut off all of the Argus Trading Company’s deals unless she were immediately removed. Faced with no other option, X’ioga cut her loose to preserve her father’s legacy (and the livelihoods of those working in the Company), leaving her adrift.</p>
            <p class="page__body">Completely unable to manage her money, Sunna stumbled from false friend to false friend, begging for a place to stay - as soon as they learned the money was gone, she was turned out at each one. Faced with no other option, she went to Kathrine, of Cold Throne Steel. Sunna had invested in the shop some months prior, and, thankfully, the investment had resulted in Kathrine having enough room to house her - on the condition that Sunna provide for the house. She had to find herself a proper job.</p>
            <p class="page__body">After a week went by with no success, she contacted a former business partner of hers - Kumope Yemope, a lalafell who had been her primary source of her more illegal pastimes for years. Asking if he had any ideas on where to find work, he pointed her to the Gilded Mortar, a small group of alchemists with somewhat lower standards than the Alchemist’s guild. To help her breeze through the interview process, he also gave her a potent potion of intelligence.</p>
            <p class="page__body">However, when she met with Baldwin, the leader of the organization, the plan quickly fell apart. Baldwin discovered that she had used an intelligence potion in order to falsely heighten her abilities, and realized that he could take advantage of that for his own ends. He put her to work synthesizing basic reagents until her potion wore off, then, while she was back in her admittedly-absent-minded state, gave her another potion of intelligence and told her to finish her shift. This one, however, contained a subtle and insidious poison that would prevent her mind from forming new memories so long as it was in her system.</p>
            <p class="page__body">With her unknowingly imbibing memory-stealing potions at work, she had no idea just what it was that she was doing. To make matters worse, she was naive enough to blame the memory loss on her not being able to understand what she was doing, as she believed that whatever work she was doing was simply far too complex for her non-potion-enhanced mind to recall. As such, she soon became deeply entangled within the schemes of the Gilded Mortar, who used her to produce deadly and illegal poisons, selling them to assassins and cutthroats for incredible sums.</p>
            <p class="page__body">The plan was only revealed when, while at work, the potion-enhanced Viera stealthily penned coded messages to herself and his them on her person. Unfortunately, her mind was not quick enough without the potions to decipher them - but with the help of Kathrine and Bardon of Cold Throne Steel, the contents were revealed after four days of work, exposing the entire plan of the Gilded Mortar - including that Baldwin was likely about to kidnap her, growing suspicious of her recent actions.</p>
            <p class="page__body">As such, Kathrine ordered Sunna to not leave the house without an armed guard, the entire company now at the forefront of a battle between the rogue alchemists of the Gilded Mortar, who sought to kidnap her, and the agents of the Brass Blades, who searched for the alchemist responsible for the poisonings. Sunna soon found tasks to busy herself with back at home, however, with Kathrine lending her the funds necessary to purchase herself alchemist’s supplies of her own, and even hiring her a tutor from the alchemist’s guild to teach her the craft properly.</p>
            <p class="page__body">After months of languishing in what was effectively house arrest, Sunna’s life was put in danger once more when the Gilded Mortar came to abduct her. Through a combined effort of the entire blacksmith’s shop, the ruffians were beaten back and their leader arrested, though not without a cost - many of the shop’s workers, and even Kathrine herself, were injured as a result. After seeing how her friends had thrown themselves into such peril to save her, Sunna vowed to do better by them, and began working to become more independent and responsible.</p>
            <p class="page__body">After a chance meeting with Skoll Suneather, a mysterious Viera blue mage, she began learning a branch of blue magic that stemmed from deep within the Golmore Jungle, looking for a way to protect herself and her friends. It has been a long and difficult road, and she is only just beginning, but she has given her all to mastering this strange discipline. Due to the manner in which the magic works, she has had mythril-ink designs of various beasts tattooed onto her body, allowing her to temporarily shift her form to better protect herself.</p>
            <p class="page__body">A strange encounter with an enchanted artifact (that she accidentally dropped and shattered) resulted in her aether being bound to two others in the blacksmith’s shop - Bardon and Kathrine. As result, all three of them share sensations, what one feels, the other two do as well. The more straight-laced Bardon and Kathrine soon tired of dealing with Sunna’s habits and how they affected them, and they set out on an expedition to the ruins in which the artifact had first been found, to break the curse. However, a rather unfortunate airship crash brought them down, where they were attacked by bandits. Barely managing to escape thanks to her new blue magic abilities, she was permanently scarred after killing a man during the chaos.</p>
            <p class="page__body">Struggling with the consequences and responsibilities of her newfound power, she does her best to keep up her front of laughter and merriment, all while trying to wrestle with her own image of herself. Through help from Taerha and Skoll, she gradually processed the trauma and came out of the experience with hardened resolve.</p>
            <p class="page__body">Months later, Sunna, Taerha, Kathrine, and Bardon journeyed once more to end their strange curse, barely surviving a brutal ruin filled with deadly magics, but ultimately achieving their goal, separating the unwanted bond between them. It was then that she revealed what she had known for only a moon, that she was pregnant with Skoll’s children, a result of her desperate attempts to lose herself in the Rava’s affections after the trauma of the airship.</p>
            <p class="page__body">She now is on a precipice, dealing with an unexpected pregnancy, her very way of life shattered as she struggles to accept how things will change for her. Her friends and lovers have shown her nothing but support, however, and her prior dread and despair have gradually lessened, and she has begun to attempt some sort of pale optimism towards her new life. However, she now is planning to return to X’ioga, the Miqo’te having reluctantly offered her financial support, on the condition that she stay at a villa where she can be watched, ensuring that she will not cause further shame to the company.</p>

Sunna often turns to the kind botanist for help, whether that be through her teas and infusions or, much more commonly, her incredible emotional support and life advice. Without a doubt, Tae is one of the people that Sunna cares for and trusts the most, and she is one of the major driving forces in Sunna’s attempts to improve herself. In particular, Taerha even has been helping her acquire the ‘materials’ needed for her blue mage training, protecting her as she guides her through the wilderness.</p>

              <h3 class="page__subtitle">Kathrine Throne</h3>
              <p class="page__body">Sunna’s landlady and creditor, who took her in when all others cast her aside. She is one of the few people Sunna has enough sense to properly fear and respect, having seen hints of the rage that burns beneath her cold exterior, as well as its grim results. However, she has also forged a deep bond with the woman over time, and trusts her entirely. The two of them have gradually grown closer, but Sunna is still somewhat in awe of the woman’s strong character.</p>

              <h3 class="page__subtitle">Bardon Steele</h3>
              <p class="page__body">An accomplished astrologian and Kathrine’s direct apprentice. Though easily distracted and at times almost as absent-minded as Sunna herself, he possesses a sharp mind, and his skill at astrology has proven sufficient to accurately predict the future - though none heeded the warnings of his cards. Though he is often at odds with her, she still considers him a friend. She respects him for his healing abilities, but resents his judging nature.</p>

              <h3 class="page__subtitle">Kriv Delmirev</h3>
              <p class="page__body">A suspiciously-wealthy archer, formerly part of a group of monster-slayers, who helped out Sunna a number of times when she was low on funds. His generosity endeared him to her, and she truly appreciated his gifts. He soon grew rather protective of her, seeking to change her ways and make her into a more respectable woman, with only some success. Even so, he cares for her as if she were his own daughter, which she rather enjoys taking advantage of. She has managed to get him into the blacksmith’s shop, securing a job for him as the shop’s monster hunter. He is her only male lover, and Sunna cherishes him dearly.</p>

              <p class="page__body">Sunna’s former personal chef, now working for all of Cold Throne Steel. She is entirely unaware that he is in fact a straggler from a group of vicious bandits, and is simply doing his best to survive until he rejoins the group. She thinks of him only as her loyal, uncommunicative servant - though she is quite grateful for him staying with her even after her financial difficulties.</p>

              <p class="page__body">A young Hingan painter Sunna and Alyngeim found being assaulted by loan sharks on the streets of Ul’Dah. Sunna is unaware that the woman is in fact a noble and a samurai besides, not to mention a particularly notorious vigilante back in Hingashi. She brought her into Cold Throne Steel to protect her from Ul’dah’s seedy underbelly, and has made fast friends with the charming painter.</p>

              <p class="page__body">Kathrine’s personal bodyguard. He and Sunna have crossed paths quite a few times - at first in an antagonistic manner (as she saw him as a rival investor, seeking to undermine her profits), then more amicably once her misunderstandings were resolved. She knows little of him, but enjoys his brusque, easygoing manner.</p>

              <p class="page__body">A former gladiator, Czethgar ran deep into debt and was sold to Sunna as an indentured servant. She promptly freed him, then bid him to work for her as an employee, instead of as a slave. He loyally followed her, and the two had a quite amicable relationship, becoming lovers quickly, once her charms won him over.</p>

            <h2 class="page__title">OOC</h2>
            <p class="page__body">I am a long-time rper (been rping since 2007!), but somewhat new to Final Fantasy RP (or any MMO rp). I tend to write para to multi-para consistently, though I try to tone my wordiness down when in group settings or a faster-paced scene. I am generally able to get along with most anyone, and am not a huge stickler for lore (though I find characters that use the existing lore creatively to be my very favourites), but I do require full literacy from my partners to get any fun out of it. I enjoy weaving everything that happens into a single cohesive story, and try to avoid declaring things as “non-canon” unless absolutely needed. I’m into ERP (almost anything goes with me), but I honestly prefer long-term, story-focused rps nowadays. I work full-time, and have a variety of real-life obligations that prevent me from spending every day online, but I do try to be on frequently - and if I make a date to RP, I do my best to keep it. I’m also happy to share my Discord handle to those who want to reach me there (I love rping in Discord too, by the way - IM rp is what I’ve been doing for most my life, after all! I tend to be FAR more responsive there!)</p>
            <p class="page__body">All in all, feel free to reach out! I’m sure that you and I will get along!</p>

            <p class="page__body">Sunna has a violently energetic aether, aspected strongly to lightning, and a bit less strongly towards water. It is chaotic, often flaring with her moods, but never dims for long. As well, the various hidden tattoos on her body are each filled with a different beast’s aether, making her own seem even more mixed-up.</p>
